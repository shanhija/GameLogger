		GameLogger history histogram widget
		
		The attribute data-order defines which calculation is used to order the games. 
		
		The contents of this div defines the prototype which is replicated for each game in the histogram.
		The replication also changes game-related values to specified locations. The directive is to add
		data-instance="<type>" for the elements that need to be changed. The <type> parameter has the following
		values and corresponding meanings:
			name		The contents of the element is replaced with the name of the game
			pic			Same as above, but the game image is added to within the element
			played		Same as above, but the contents is replaced with the time the game was played. 
						This is the sum of the times each player had the game on.
			walltime	Same as above, but the amount is now the time at least one of the players had
						the game on. For example, if 4 people all had the game on for one day, this value
						is 24 hours. No matter if one or two didn't have the game on for the entire day,
						as long as at least one had it on for the whole day.						
			width-played The CSS width of the element is set to the percentage the game was played with
						respect to the most played game. For example, if Game1 was played 5h and Game2 was
						played 2h, and Game1 was the most played game, the element with widthPlayed for
						Game2 is set to 2/5*100% = 40%.
			width-walltime
						Same as above but the calculations are done with walltime.			
			bg			CSS background of the image is set to: url("<picurl>") no-repeat;
			bg-color	CSS background-color is set to the color of the game
			color		CSS color is set to the color of the game

				Constructs a single timeline history view that comprises of several timelines.
				
				APM timeline shows the apm of a single player over the whole history in the database.
				It automatically uses a color gradient for the games if it exists.
				
				Game timeline shows each game as a box (a div) extending over the time it was played.
				When the user hovers over a box, it triggers events  that a tooltip can be used to 
				bind to. See .gl-history-timeline-tooltip
				
				Ticks timeline shows the times for timelines				
				
				
				The contents of the container are wrapped to within a single div. When the user zooms
				the view with mouse wheel, the wrapper's width is scaled accordingly and the timelines
				will be updated to extend the whole width of the wrapper. The original container will 
				retain its width, and therefore, the wrapper will extend outside the container (overflow).
				CSS overflow is set to hidden for the container, and therefore, the container provides
				a view to a part of the the wrapper. When the user moves the timelines, only the wrapper
				is moved and everything is updated by the browser automatically.

				A tooltip showing detailed information about a specific game session. When connected to a 
				timeline (automatic) and a user hovers over a game in a timeline, the tooltip is shown and
				its contents is updated. When the mouse leaves the game, it is hidden.
				
				Note: Only the first found tooltip is used and it is connected to all existing 
				gl-history-timeline -elements
				
				data-follow-x attribute defines that the tooltip should follow the horizontal movement of 
				the mouse. The attribute accepts two values: left, right. With left, the CSS property
				left of this class is set to the same value as the user's mouse x. With right, the same
				CSS property is changed, but the value to set is the mouse x-coordingate + tooltip window
				width. 
				
				data-follow-y is the very similar to data-follow-y, but the accepted values are top and bottom.
				
				Note: when data-follow-x or data-follow-y are missing, the corresponding change is not made.
				So if you want for the tooltip to remain in its place, do not define these attributes.
